This repository contains my work for the following:
Web Programming class at Tufts University Department of Computer Science, Spring 2013

My favorite project was a5 (scorecenter) because I enjoyed learning about heroku and web frameworks with databases and the API.

I'm most proud of my scorecenter because it demonstrates a lot of useful knowledge of how to make a useful server-side application.

This course has been a good introduction to web programming, and I now feel comfortable with javascript and the possibilities of at least some of what can be accomplished using the web. The web is one of the biggest pieces of society today and a driving force in the world, and I'm glad to have gained some knowledge of how it works and how to take advantage of it.
